## Tales Of A Nigerian Youth (The Protest)

should I be killed because I am **YOUNG**?

should I be killed because I am trying to make a way for **MY SELF**?

should I be killed because I **DRESS GOOD** and don't let my situation weigh me down?

should I be killed because I am a **MILLENIAL**?

should I be killed by the **POLICE**?

should I be killed because I am a **CITIZEN**?
 
 
 It's hard to ignore the current situation of things going on in Nigeria, it's hard to ignore the fact that as the day breaks and the sun sets, young Nigerians are being killed.
 
 It's hard to ignore that, designated Law officials are taking the lives of the **FUTURE**. Families are losing loved ones, friends are losing friends because those who are meant to protect us are **HUNTING** us.

 ## AM I NEXT?
 
 Mr. police, am I next too? Will you take my life just as you did my friends? Will you take my life because I am trying to make a better life for myself? will you take my life because I don't dress raggedy? Will you take my life because I am a techie, or because I have a laptop with me? Will you take my life just for being me?
 
 Why should I have to go out in fear in a place I call home, the motherland doesn't seem so caring anymore, it looks like everyday vices are set up against the Nigerian youth, it seems like our leaders make it so hard for us to succeed. 
 
 This is why we are protesting #EndSars, it needs to stop, all the killings, all the harassment from the police, all the police brutality, it needs to stop.
 
 where ever you are reading this right now, **YOUR VOICE HELPS**, nothing is too small, stand with us as a community. Tweet this, post this, air this, we have to put an end to the **INJUSTICE**.
